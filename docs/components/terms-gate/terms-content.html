    <strong>Company identity (replace before production use):</strong><br />
    Haiphen (“Company”) is a signals-intelligence engineering studio operated as
    <strong>[LEGAL ENTITY NAME]</strong> in <strong>[JURISDICTION]</strong>, with a principal place of business at
    <strong>[REGISTERED ADDRESS]</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>1) Purpose and scope</h3>
<p>
  This Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) governs your access to and use of Haiphen’s software, APIs, dashboards,
  documentation, datasets, alerts, and related tooling (collectively, the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
  Haiphen is a technology provider focused on <strong>signals intelligence</strong>: we build inspectable, telemetry-heavy
  systems that ingest signals, compute metrics, and publish artifacts. The Services may include trading telemetry and
  analytics, but they are provided as technical outputs and system observability—not as advice.
</p>

<h3>2) Not investment advice; no fiduciary relationship</h3>
<p>
  Haiphen is <strong>not</strong> a broker-dealer, investment adviser, commodity trading adviser, or financial planner,
  and the Services do not provide investment advice, legal advice, tax advice, or accounting advice.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing in the Services, on haiphen.io, or delivered via API, email, dashboards, documentation, or communications
  constitutes a recommendation, solicitation, endorsement, or offer to buy or sell any security, commodity, digital asset,
  or other financial instrument.
</p>
<p>
  You are solely responsible for all decisions, actions, and outcomes. You acknowledge that markets are volatile and losses can be substantial.
</p>

<h3>3) Value proposition and service model</h3>
<p>
  Your subscription (or other paid access) purchases ongoing access to a living software product. The Company will ship
  regular updates, bug fixes, new features, endpoints, and operational improvements over time.
</p>
<p>
  Prices are fixed to your current plan while active, but the Services themselves may evolve. Some features may be added,
  modified, deprecated, or removed as the product matures.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Examples of deliverables: API endpoints, published metric artifacts, documentation updates, dashboard features, reliability improvements.</li>
  <li>Some functionality may be labeled alpha/beta and may be less stable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Accounts, eligibility, and access control</h3>
<p>
  Access may require authentication (for example, via GitHub login) and may be gated by entitlement status. You agree to provide
  accurate account information and keep credentials secure.
</p>
<p>
  You must not share API keys or access tokens outside your organization (or outside your personal use) unless the Company explicitly permits it.
</p>

<h3>5) Acceptable use</h3>
<p>You agree not to misuse the Services. Prohibited conduct includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, networks, or data.</li>
  <li>Abusing rate limits, interfering with availability, or attempting denial-of-service behavior.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineering, scraping, or harvesting data at scale in violation of published limits or documentation.</li>
  <li>Using the Services for unlawful activity or to violate third-party rights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6) Data, telemetry, and accuracy</h3>
<p>
  The Services may surface metrics, signals, alerts, or other outputs derived from external data sources and internal pipelines.
  All outputs are provided “as is” and may contain errors, delays, omissions, or discontinuities.
</p>
<p>
  The Company does not warrant that any output is accurate, complete, timely, or fit for a particular purpose. You are responsible
  for validating outputs before relying on them.
</p>

<h3>7) Availability, changes, and rate limiting</h3>
<p>
  The Services may be unavailable due to maintenance, outages, upstream provider failures, internet issues, or other causes.
  The Company may implement rate limits, quotas, or other controls to protect reliability.
</p>
<p>
  The Company may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time. Where practical, the Company will provide
  notice of material changes via documentation updates or site notices.
</p>

<h3>8) Fees, billing, and renewals</h3>
<p>
  Fees are charged according to the plan you select and the payment terms presented at checkout. Unless otherwise stated,
  subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled.
</p>
<p>
  If payment fails or your subscription ends, access may be suspended or terminated.
</p>

<h3>9) Intellectual property</h3>
<p>
  The Services, including software, documentation, and content, are owned by the Company and protected by intellectual property laws.
</p>
<p>
  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license
  to access and use the Services for your internal purposes during an active subscription.
</p>

<h3>10) Confidentiality and security</h3>
<p>
  If the Company provides non-public information designated as confidential, you agree to protect it using reasonable care and to use it only
  for the purpose of evaluating or using the Services.
</p>
<p>
  You are responsible for securing your environment, including where you store API credentials and any data you export.
</p>
