<h3>2) Purpose and scope</h3>
<p>
  This Agreement governs your access to and use of the Services. The Services are a technology product and may include technical outputs,
  telemetry, metrics, and analytics. Where you purchase a Cohort, the Cohort is governed by this Agreement and the Cohort Service Level Addendum (Exhibit A).
</p>

<h3>3) Order of precedence</h3>
<p>
  If there is any conflict between documents, the following order controls: (1) the applicable Order Form,
  (2) this Agreement, (3) Exhibit A (Cohort Service Level Addendum), and (4) referenced policies.
  Marketing pages, emails, or verbal statements are not binding unless expressly included in an Order Form.
</p>

<h3>4) Not investment advice; no fiduciary relationship</h3>
<p>
  Haiphen is <strong>not</strong> a broker-dealer, investment adviser, commodity trading adviser, or financial planner, and the Services do not provide
  investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing in the Services (including on haiphen.io, via API, email, dashboards, documentation, or communications) constitutes a recommendation,
  solicitation, endorsement, or offer to buy or sell any security, commodity, digital asset, or other financial instrument.
</p>
<p>
  You are solely responsible for all decisions, actions, and outcomes. Markets are volatile and losses can be substantial.
</p>

<h3>5) Accounts, eligibility, and access control</h3>
<p>
  Access may require authentication and may be gated by entitlement status. You agree to provide accurate account information and keep credentials secure.
  You must not share API keys or access tokens outside your organization (or outside your personal use) unless explicitly permitted by the Company.
</p>

<h3>6) Acceptable use</h3>
<p>You agree not to misuse the Services. Prohibited conduct includes:</p>

  <li>Reverse engineering, scraping, or harvesting data at scale in violation of documentation or published limits.</li>
  <li>Using the Services for unlawful activity or to violate third-party rights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7) Intellectual property; license</h3>
<p>
  The Services and Materials are owned by the Company and protected by intellectual property laws.
  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license
  to access and use the Services for your internal purposes during an active subscription or Cohort term.
</p>
<p>
  You may not copy, sell, sublicense, redistribute, or publish Materials except as expressly permitted in writing by the Company.
</p>

<h3>8) Data, telemetry, and accuracy</h3>
<p>
  The Services may surface metrics, signals, alerts, or outputs derived from external data sources and internal pipelines.
  All outputs are provided “as is” and may contain errors, delays, omissions, or discontinuities.
</p>
<p>
  The Company does not warrant that any output is accurate, complete, timely, or fit for a particular purpose. You are responsible for validating outputs before relying on them.
</p>

<h3>9) Availability, changes, and rate limiting</h3>
<p>
  The Services may be unavailable due to maintenance, outages, upstream provider failures, internet issues, or other causes.
  The Company may implement rate limits, quotas, or other controls to protect reliability.
</p>
<p>
  The Company may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services. Where practical, the Company will provide notice of material changes via documentation updates or site notices.
</p>

<h3>10) Fees, billing, renewals</h3>
<p>
  Fees are charged according to the plan you select and the payment terms presented at checkout or in an Order Form.
  Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled.
</p>
<p>
  If payment fails or your subscription ends, access may be suspended or terminated.
</p>

<h3>11) Confidentiality and security</h3>
<p>
  If the Company provides non-public information designated as confidential, you agree to protect it using reasonable care and to use it only for the purpose of evaluating or using the Services.
  You are responsible for securing your environment, including where you store API credentials and any data you export.

<h2>Exhibit A — Cohort Service Level Addendum (3-Month Cohort)</h2>

<p class="muted" style="opacity:.85;font-size:13px;">
  This Exhibit applies only if you purchase a Cohort via an Order Form. If there is a conflict, the Order Form controls.
</p>

<h3>A1) Term; format</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Term:</strong> three (3) months starting on the Start Date in the Order Form.</li>
  <li><strong>Format:</strong> combination of live sessions, office hours, async support, and materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Reasonable changes:</strong> Company may adjust session times/instructor for operational reasons provided overall scope is not materially reduced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A2) Deliverables</h3>
<p>Deliverables are those explicitly listed in the Order Form. Typical deliverables may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live instruction sessions and cohort curriculum.</li>
  <li>Office hours / Q&amp;A.</li>
  <li>Templates, checklists, and reference implementations.</li>
  <li>Architecture reviews and milestone feedback (as described in the Order Form).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Anything not listed in the Order Form is out of scope. The Cohort is educational and enablement-focused; it is not a managed services engagement.
</p>

<h3>A3) Service levels (targets)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Async response target:</strong> within <strong>[24–72]</strong> business hours (set in Order Form) for cohort channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Access issues:</strong> within <strong>[4–12]</strong> business hours (set in Order Form) for problems joining scheduled sessions or accessing paid materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Business hours:</strong> <strong>Mon–Fri, 9am–5pm America/Chicago</strong>, excluding U.S. market holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are targets, not guarantees, and exclude outages caused by third parties (e.g., GitHub, Cloudflare, Stripe, Google, Slack, Zoom).
</p>

<h3>A4) Client responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attend sessions and complete required prep work to receive value from the Cohort.</li>
  <li>Maintain access to required tools/accounts and pay any third-party fees.</li>
  <li>Provide accurate information and avoid sharing confidential credentials in public channels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A5) Refunds; transfers</h3>
<p>
  Refund and transfer terms must be explicitly defined in the Order Form. If not specified, Fees are non-refundable once the Cohort Start Date occurs.
