      <h2 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #5A9BD4; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">General</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What is Haiphen in one sentence? <span class="faq-tag">general</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Haiphen is a signals-intelligence engineering studio: we build inspectable, production-grade pipelines for ML/NLP, security, and telemetry-heavy systems — including the trading telemetry you see on our platform.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What does "API Everything" actually mean here? <span class="faq-tag">general</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">It means every meaningful output is <em>addressable</em>: metrics are published as JSON, screenshots are generated deterministically, and internal steps emit traceable intermediate state. The UI is basically a viewer for those artifacts.</div>
      </details>

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #5A9BD4; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">Services & Delivery</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What deliverables do you actually ship? <span class="faq-tag">services</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Typically: (1) a working pipeline/service, (2) published artifacts (JSON, exports, screenshots), (3) observability (logs/metrics/traces) + runbooks, (4) reliability hardening (retries/idempotency/backfills), and (5) security boundaries (least privilege, key rotation posture).</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What does a "thin vertical slice" mean in practice? <span class="faq-tag">engineering</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">One signal, one decision, one output. Example: ingest a single source, compute a KPI, publish JSON, render one UI widget, and add monitoring. Once it's reliable, scale horizontally (more signals).</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do you define success for a project? <span class="faq-tag">services</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Success is measurable: latency/throughput targets, error budgets, alert coverage, correctness checks, and the ability to explain any output (lineage). If you can't debug it, you don't own it.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can you integrate with our existing stack? <span class="faq-tag">services</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Yes — we usually meet you where you are: your cloud, your CI, your observability, your auth. The goal is to reduce operational friction, not add another mystery system.</div>
      </details>

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #5A9BD4; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">Security & Data</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>How do you handle sensitive data? <span class="faq-tag">security</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">We design for least privilege and separation of concerns: scoped tokens, minimized retention, audit logs, and clear data boundaries. If needed we can keep raw data in your environment and only publish derived artifacts.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are the trading metrics investment advice? <span class="faq-tag">disclaimer</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">No. They're operational telemetry from an automated execution and risk system (volume, stability, daily outcomes). Nothing on this site is a recommendation to buy/sell any asset.</div>
      </details>

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #5A9BD4; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">Cloud-Native & Deployment</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What is Haiphen's deployment model? <span class="faq-tag">cloud-native</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Haiphen runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers — a serverless edge compute platform with 200+ global PoPs. There are no VMs, containers, or infrastructure to manage. Your requests are processed at the nearest edge location with sub-millisecond cold starts.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I self-host Haiphen? <span class="faq-tag">cloud-native</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">Currently Haiphen is offered as a managed cloud service only. The CLI (<code>haiphen serve</code>) runs a local gateway on your machine that proxies authenticated requests to our edge infrastructure. This gives you a local endpoint while we handle reliability, scaling, and security.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What infrastructure do I need to use Haiphen? <span class="faq-tag">cloud-native</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">None. Install the CLI via Homebrew (<code>brew install haiphenAI/tap/haiphen</code>), Docker, or call the API directly. Authentication is handled via GitHub OAuth. There are no databases, queues, or servers to provision on your end.</div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What are the benefits of Haiphen's cloud-native architecture? <span class="faq-tag">cloud-native</span></summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ul style="padding-left: 1.25rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
            <li><strong>Zero ops overhead</strong> — no servers, containers, or infrastructure to manage</li>
            <li><strong>Global low-latency</strong> — requests served from 200+ Cloudflare edge PoPs</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic scaling</strong> — no capacity planning or autoscaler tuning</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in security</strong> — DDoS protection, TLS termination, and WAF included</li>
            <li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong> — pay only for compute used, no idle resource costs</li>
