  <h1>OpSec for Mom</h1>
  <p><strong>Open source, Apache, and cloud-native habits for everyday security.</strong></p>

  <p>Last week I asked my mom where she keeps her passwords. She said, "In my head. Mostly." That is exactly why OpSec for Mom exists.</p>
  <p>Operational security does not need to be scary or technical. It is a set of calm, repeatable habits that protect your devices, accounts, and home. Think of it like locking the doors before bed.</p>

  <h2>Why open source, Apache, and cloud-native ideas matter</h2>
  <p>Open source communities and Apache projects succeed because they are transparent, tested by many people, and improved quickly. Cloud-native systems focus on resilience and recovery, not just prevention. Those same ideas work at home:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Use tools that are well documented and widely reviewed.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeatability:</strong> Simple routines beat complicated one-time fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Assume mistakes happen and make recovery easy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Start with the foundation</h2>
  <p>Most security problems disappear if you consistently do the basics. The base of the pyramid does the heavy lifting.</p>

  <h2>A quick 15-minute setup</h2>
  <p>If you only have a few minutes, this five-step checklist covers most everyday risk.</p>

  <h2>Everyday checklists</h2>
  <h3>Laptop</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn on automatic updates for the operating system and browser.</li>
    <li>Enable full disk encryption.</li>
    <li>Use a standard account for daily work, not the admin account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phone</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a real passcode, not a simple pattern.</li>
    <li>Enable "find my device" in case it is lost.</li>
    <li>Only install apps from official stores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Accounts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a password manager so every account has a unique password.</li>
    <li>Turn on two-factor authentication, starting with email.</li>
    <li>Store recovery codes in a safe place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Smart home</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Change default passwords on devices.</li>
    <li>Put smart devices on a separate guest or IoT network.</li>
    <li>Unplug devices you do not use.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Figure 5. Keep smart devices separate from phones and laptops.</em></p>

  <h3>Backups</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep one cloud backup and one local copy.</li>
    <li>Test the backup once a month.</li>
    <li>Backups are recovery, not just storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The point is calm, not fear</h2>
  <p>Security is not about paranoia. It is about freedom - the freedom to use tech without constant worry. If you help a parent, a friend, or yourself set up these basics, you are already doing good OpSec.</p>
